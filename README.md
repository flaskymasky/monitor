# monitor
watches every file ( on the whole system ), if it got manually modified then logs it with timestamp and path ( needs root ) ( paths are somewhat buggy but you can see the path
need regular expression to fix that



### bugs ###
needs new log file after ~ 200.000 bytes or it will crash

### fix ###

short code by creating function for the event cases

# monitor
monitors every file  on the whole system, if it got manually modified then logs it with timestamp and path ( needs root ) ( paths are somewhat buggy but you can see the path
need regular expression to fix that

log file path : /tmp/secret
just change like u want




### bugs ###
needs new log file after ~ 200.000 bytes or it will crash

### fix ###

make code shorter by creating function for the event cases
